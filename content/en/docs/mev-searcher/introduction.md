MEV, or Miner Extractable Value is an incredibly misleading term. It was originally used to convey the value that can be extracted by exploiting the ordering of transactions, usually only doable by miners, as they determine of the ordering of transactions within a block.

These days its a catch all phrase used to describe any value that can be extracted from the blockchain, regardless if the ordering of transactions was exploited or not.

MEV and can be divided into two categories:
- Short Tail MEV: High volume, high competition, low margins
- Long Tail MEV: Low volume, low competition, high margins

While practicing it can be generalized into three steps:
1. Identify
2. Analyze
3. Execute

A common mistake searchers (with a developer background) make is the need to have everything in place before starting. That mentality will only slow you down. Just do, don't think.

If you know how to program, and how to use Google, you're good to go. Remember your program doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to work.

## Tools Of The Trade

These are tools of the trade that I recommend in no particular order.

- Programming Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Solidity
- Telemetrics: Grafana, Discord/Telegram alerts.
- Infrastructure: AWS, GCP, Azure, Flashbots, baremetal
- Maths (Optional): x * y = k, optimization techniques
